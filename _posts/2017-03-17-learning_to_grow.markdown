About five years ago, I started interning at a local social events magazine that was undergoing a total website revamp. Eager to be a good little intern, I volunteered to learn all I could about how to maintain it. I'm now the editor at said magazine and still handle the same website. Along the way, there have been a few issues that I wished I could fix myself, but knowing nothing about coding, I had to rely on the programmers who hosted our site. This sparked my interest in programming.

I would casually say to friends every now and then, "I want to learn how to code," and very occassionaly would try my hand at some free online courses but never took the dive. As a birchbox subscriber, I received an email about the Women Take Tech scholarhsip and partnership wtih Flatiron, and I decided to apply on a whim. A few phone calls and emails with Flatiron staff and several long coversations with my husband, I decided to take the dive! It probably wasn't the most ideal time, as I'm expecting our first child at the end of May and we have no idea what we're getting ourselves into; but when is it ever a bad idea to learn and grow?

I'm excited about all the challenges I'll overcome throughout taking this course, and I'm anxious to see how I'll feel at the end of it. I love that Flatiron is promoting women in the tech industry, and I hope to one day have a fulfilling career as a web developer - weather it's professionally or personally.
